## 1. CIFTI Format and Grayordinates
What it is: A unified coordinate system combining cortical surface vertices and subcortical volume voxels into "grayordinates."

Why we do this: for space efficiency! Reduces storage by 84% compared to storing full brain volumes.
Gray matter on the cortex is a 2D sheet (better analyzed as a surface), while subcortical structures are truly 3D
Better alignment: Surface-based registration aligns cortical areas better than volume-based methods.

## 2. Gradient Nonlinearity Correction
What it is: Correcting spatial distortions caused by imperfect magnetic field gradients.

Why we do this: MRI scanners assume perfectly linear gradients, but they're actually slightly curved.
Objects appear stretched or compressed, especially far from the scanner's center; we need accurate anatomy before any analysis.

## 3. Two-Stage Registration Strategy
What it is: Creating both a "native space" (individual's true brain size) and "MNI space" (standard atlas).
Why we do this: Native space: Preserves true brain dimensions for measuring volumes and doing tractography.
MNI space: Enables comparison across subjects and studies.

## 4. T1w/T2w Myelin Mapping
What it is: Using the ratio of T1-weighted to T2-weighted images to map cortical myelin content.
Why we do this: Myelin content helps identify boundaries between brain areas.
T1w brightens myelin, T2w darkens it - the ratio amplifies the contrast. Like using two different photo filters to enhance specific features. 

## 5. Readout Distortion Correction
What it is: Fixing subtle stretching that occurs differently in T1w vs T2w images due to different readout speeds.
Why we do this: Even small misalignments (≤1mm) between structural images affect surface reconstruction.
Critical for accurate myelin maps which require perfect T1w/T2w alignment.

## 6. High-Resolution Surface Reconstruction (0.7mm)
What it is: Using sub-millimeter resolution for creating brain surfaces.
Why we do this: Thin cortical regions (like the visual or sensory cortex) need high resolution to be accurately traced
Prevents surfaces from "cutting through" gray matter in tight spaces
Like needing a fine-tip pen rather than a marker to trace intricate patterns

## 7. Ribbon-Constrained Volume-to-Surface Mapping
What it is: Only using voxels between white and pial surfaces when mapping fMRI to surfaces.
Why we do this: Excludes signals from CSF, blood vessels, and white matter.
Handles partial volume effects at surface boundaries.

## 8. Surface-Based Smoothing vs Volume Smoothing
Smoothing data along the cortical surface rather than in 3D space.
Why we do this: Cortical areas separated by a sulcus are far apart functionally but close in 3D.
Prevents mixing signals from different functional areas.

## 9. Motion Correction to Single-Band Reference
What it is: Aligning all fMRI timepoints to a high-contrast reference image.
Why we do this: Multi-band fMRI has poor tissue contrast due to fast acquisition.
Single-band reference has better anatomy for registration to structural images.
Like using a clear photo as a reference rather than a blurry video frame.

## 10. Bias Field Correction Using T1w×T2w
What it is: Using the geometric mean of T1w and T2w images to estimate intensity inhomogeneity.
Why we do this: Traditional methods assume uniform white matter intensity (incorrect due to varying myelin).
T1w and T2w biases are similar, but tissue contrasts are opposite - multiplying them cancels tissue contrast while preserving bias.
Like finding lighting inconsistencies by comparing photos taken with different camera settings.

## 11. Coefficient of Variation Masking
What it is: Excluding voxels with abnormally high temporal variance relative to neighbors.
Why we do this: Removes signals from blood vessels and brain edges.
Reduces "gyral bias" where noisy voxels concentrate on gyral crowns.
Like removing static from specific radio frequencies while keeping the clear channels.

## 12. Parcel-Constrained Subcortical Smoothing
What it is: Smoothing within the anatomical boundaries of subcortical structures.
Why we do this: Prevents mixing signals between the thalamus and ventricles, for example
Respects anatomical boundaries while reducing noise.
Like applying blur within each shape in a picture without bleeding across edges
