# Left–Right Lobe Asymmetry Analysis in ASL Perfusion MRI

Overview: Brain perfusion asymmetry (left vs. right hemisphere or lobes) can be assessed at different scales. Below we compare voxel-based, ROI-based, and surface-based methods for analyzing asymmetry in arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion MRI. For each, we explain how asymmetries are quantified, provide any relevant formula with asymmetry indices (AI) with attention to sensitivity, spatial resolution, and robustness. 

1. Region-of-Interest (ROI) volumetry: Segment each anatomical lobe or nucleus, add up all voxels on each side, and compare the two scalars.
It compare perfusion values aggregated over predefined regions on the left and right, such as lobes. It takes the average CBF in the entire left frontal lobe and right frontal lobe and computes a difference. ROI methods reduce the problem to comparing a few summary values (one per region per side) instead of every voxel.

Toolkits like FSL provide parcellations: one can use an atlas to extract left/right ROI mean CBF and then compute asymmetry. 

```python
import nibabel as nib
import numpy as np

# 1. Load T1 and labels
img = nib.load('T1.nii.gz')
labels = nib.load('labels_LR.nii.gz')  # ROI mask with left/right-coded regions

data = img.get_fdata()
labs = labels.get_fdata()

# 2. For each ROI pair compute volumes
def roi_volume(label_idx_left, label_idx_right):
    V_L = np.sum(data[labs == label_idx_left] > 0)
    V_R = np.sum(data[labs == label_idx_right] > 0)
    return (V_L - V_R) / ((V_L + V_R) / 2)

# example
print("Temporal lobe AI:", roi_volume(17, 53))
```

2. Voxel-Based Asymmetry: Voxel-wise methods compute asymmetry at each voxel by comparing perfusion in a location on the left vs. the corresponding location on the right hemisphere. This typically involves registering the brain to a symmetric template or directly flipping one hemispheric image and subtracting it from the other. The result is an asymmetry index map highlighting where perfusion differs between hemispheres
- AI_voxel(x) = (I(x) − I_mirror(x)) / ((I(x) + I_mirror(x))/2) (computed on modulated gray- or white-matter probability maps).

Voxel-based analyses offer high spatial resolution. They can detect focal asymmetries at the level of a few millimeters, without being constrained to large predetermined areas. This fine-grained approach is objective and exhaustive, surveying the whole brain for even subtle perfusion differences. It is especially useful when asymmetries are localized (e.g. a small cortical or subcortical region with reduced CBF) that ROI averaging might miss.

3. Surface-Based Morphometry (SBM)– using FreeSurfer: Vertex-wise cortical thickness, surface area, gyrification.
Surface-based analysis involves projecting perfusion data onto the cortical surface and leveraging cortical topology to assess asymmetry.
The intuitive idea is that surface-based methods respect the geometry of the cortex, possibly allowing a more precise left-right comparison of cortical perfusion than voxel-based volume mapping.

Gyral patterns are matched on the sphere, reducing blurring across sulci that can happen with volume smoothing. This often means surface-based methods can detect differences that volume-based (voxel) methods might smooth out or miss. In fact, a recent study reported that surface-based analysis captured greater changes in perfusion between patients and controls than voxel-based analysis on the same data.

```bash
recon-all -i T1.nii.gz -subject sub01 -all
# Surfaces will include lh.thickness, rh.thickness
```
```python
import numpy as np
thick_l = np.loadtxt('sub01/surf/lh.thickness')
thick_r = np.loadtxt('sub01/surf/rh.thickness')[mirror_idx]
AI_vertex = (thick_l - thick_r) / ((thick_l + thick_r)/2)
```
Limitation: Surface-based analysis is naturally limited to cortical structures; perfusion asymmetries in deep brain (basal ganglia, thalamus, etc.) require other methods or projecting those to subcortical surfaces/ROIs. So it’s not a full replacement if subcortical perfusion is of interest.

4. Tensor-/Deformation-Based Morphometry (TBM/DBM): After registering to a symmetric template, compute the Jacobian determinant J(x) that tells local expansion/atrophy, then compare J vs. J_mirror.
- AI_TBM(x) = log J(x) − log J_mirror(x) or equivalently 2 × (J − J_mirror)/(J + J_mirror)

5. Diffusion-Tensor / White-Matter Asymmetry: Calculate Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) skeleton.
```python
FA_L = fa_skeleton[mask_L]
FA_R = fa_skeleton[mask_R_mirrored]
LI_FA = 2 * (FA_L - FA_R) / (FA_L + FA_R)
```

6. Intensity-Driven Left–Right Intensity Asymmetry (LRIA): Detect scanner-induced or pathological T1/T2-FLAIR signal shifts. 
```python
I_L = np.mean(data[labs == left_roi])
I_R = np.mean(data[labs == right_roi])
LRIA = 100 * (I_L - I_R) / ((I_L + I_R) / 2)
```

7. Shape-Specific Analyses: Represent each 3-D structure (hippocampus, amygdala…) as a set of spherical-harmonic coefficients; compare coefficient vectors or radial distance maps after mirroring.
- Shape-AI = mean|r_L(θ,φ) − r_R(θ,φ)| / mean(r_avg)

8. Functional MRI Laterality Index
- LI = (LH − RH)/(LH + RH); many variants exist (e.g., Dice/Jaccard-based)
